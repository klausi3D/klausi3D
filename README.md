Hi, I’m @klausi3D
I love making games and creating tools for creating them.

current interests:
* Achieving painterly/impressionistic real-time-rendering with gaussian splatting 
* creating tools to create content for this type of artstyle
* (apparently math and graphics APIs, because it´s not working without it)

*i just wanted some colorful splats on screen that does make npr rendering not look like action figures ... kinda escalated quickly*
